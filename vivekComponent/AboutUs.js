                    Lovely Professional university Vivek, Sumit and Gautam came up with an idea for their University. They have found that during the lunch breaks 
                    there was a lot of stampede around the food courts. Student have to stand in lines for hours to fulfil their hunger. Even they are part of it most 
                    of the time. This is happening from the last 5-10 years but no one was looked into it.</Text>

                     or after classes are over. At that time there is a lot of stampede around the food courts. The project provides an efficient way of ordering food for each
                      customer before reaching the food court. After the order is placed the vendor provides a time that you can pick your order at that time. As per the past 
                      data, students had bought food during the peak time but with the application, the system will provide a platform for the vendors to increase their selling 
                      and reduce wastage of food.
